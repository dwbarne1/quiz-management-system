Here are some basic instructions to get started:

1. Main Menu (List Questions)

When you start the program, your questions.csv file will be loaded into the program automatically. On the main menu, you will see a dropdown list, which contains various questions that this program has loaded in from your questions.csv file. Select any question from the dropdown list in order to see its specific details, namely its text, four answer choices, points value, correct answer, correct feedback, and incorrect feedback.

To return to the main menu at any time, click on the File tab in the upper left corner of the program window, and select List Questions.

2. Add Question

Click on the File tab in the upper left corner of the program window, and among the choices, you will see Add Question. When you click on this function, it will allow you to create your own new question to add to your program. Make sure to fill out every box, or else the new question will not be submitted.

3. Edit Question

Click on the File tab in the upper left corner of the program window, and select Edit Question. This function will allow you to view each question just as on the main menu, but you may now edit the question you select in the dropdown list by clicking the Edit Question button. Clicking this button will create another box below the question you are viewing, and you may change the attributes of the question. As with the Add Question function, however, nothing will be submitted unless every box has text.

4. Delete Question

Click on the File tab in the upper left corner of the program window, and select Delete Question. This menu is identical to that of Edit Question, but the button now allows you to delete the question you have selected from the dropdown list. Select any question you would like to delete, and the Delete Question button will remove it.

5. Search Question

Click on the File tab in the upper left corner of the program window, and select Search Question. This menu allows you to enter any text you would like into the text box, and then you may press the Search button to check if any question or its attributes matches your search. Upon clicking the button, a new box will appear below, generating a dropdown list that contains all the questions that fully or partially match your search text. Click on any list item to see the full question details.

6. Quiz Game

Click on the Play tab to the right of File in the upper left corner of the program window, and select Quiz Game. Clicking this item launches a quiz game, in which you are given three random and unique questions from your questions.csv file. Each question gives you four answer choices as well as feedback depending on the submission of the correct or incorrect answer. It will tally all your points after each question, and at the end, it will show you your results in terms of total points. On the results screen, select the Yes button to replay the quiz game, or select the No button to return to the main menu.

7. Exit

In order to exit the Quiz Management System, click on the File tab in the upper left corner of the program window, and select Exit. Any questions you have added, edited, or deleted will be saved accordingly in the questions.csv file upon exiting the system.
